# Outro

From Part 00 to 03, we have gone through a short (7 weeks) and a rather unconventional path to learning Python programming.

This outro serves as another background introduction for the journey onward.

## Open-source

The open-source software movement started in the 80s, initially as the "free software movement" by Richard Stallman (a.k.a RMS). Throughout its [evolutionary timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement#Brief_history), many have contributed toward its conceptualization and formulation to tackle legal, business, and to an increasingly relevant extent, societal challenges.

The immediate face-value of open-source software is already appealing to its consumers. These programs are usually free to use. Users can also change the software behaviors with some knowledge of programming to suit individual needs. For the providing party, open-sourcing brings benefits of open scrutiny to the program's quality and security measures, and a showcase of confidence, and statements of styles and opinions.

With some well-defined governance models, open-source software communities can promote a collaborative environment and onboard collaborators with little to no effort from the original authors required by conventional settings. With a mature license, the users understand the provider's limits and liabilities, greatly simplifying the usage contracts and limitations. Lastly, with proper financial backing, the software makers who pursue these projects as passions of their own tend to consistently innovate and push the boundaries.

### Transparency (opt-in)

While open-source software communities and projects present in many shapes and forms, even when they are for-profit, the one prominent trait in common is its transparency of the software source code.

The transparency of the source code and its timeline of changes and evolution leads other aspects such as the software issue/feedback tracking, feature discussions, code peer-review, product distribution, etc., to be partially or entirely open to public scrutiny. While much of those aspects get increasingly automated, the transparency allows the software development to be ever more humane and socially inclusive. It may encourage more to contribute in any aspects mentioned above.

Another implication of transparency is that it provides an organic counter-balance to a phenomenon of under-documented source code and a problem known as [leaky abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction), where an abstraction leaks details that it is supposed to abstract away. By participating in the various aspects of the open-source software development and examining the source code itself and its revision history, one can often find answers and solutions created by the lack of documentation or leaky abstraction. However difficult, it is possible for open-source software, while not for the proprietary ones.

The transparency is generally served through an opt-in model, meaning it does not forcefully present itself to unwilling participants. It is advantageous and necessary, given the amount of information generated and consumed in such an environment.

## git

Among many tools that support the entire open-source software ecosystem, one of the most important pieces would be using a version control system (VCS). A version control system allows software project management to be simpler on aspects of source code change examination (diffing), versioning and rollback, etc.

Among these VCS, `git` is the most popular one. Though not the first of its kind, known as a distributed version control system (DVCS), `git` allows very efficient distribution of source code with every user having full access to the working copy as well as the entire change history and references to code derivatives (through branches and tags). It means peer-to-peer collaborations. When unresolvable disagreements break out, one can "fork" out to evolve the software project to another trajectory without impacting other project collaborators. The forks are why we see the many different distributions of Linux operating systems (OS). Simply put, Android OS would not enjoy such a fast development and evolution if it wasn't for a DVCS such as `git`.

The implication of `git` and its contribution toward open-source communities further pushes their workflow toward a decentralized direction.

## GitHub (the company)

However, `git`, especially during its early days (since 2005), mostly due to a mindset barrier to converting from a centralized VCS to a distributed one from its users, was notoriously convoluted and hard to utilize. About two years later (toward the end of 2007), a bootstrapped company started by a group of software developers who enjoy `git` but envision more straightforward ways to use the tool.

They started building what's known as GitHub today, which makes `git` usages a pleasant experience. They created GitHub using `git` and GitHub itself, a practice known as dogfooding (or "eating your own dog food").

What's fascinating about this company is that it started profitable (or with a convincing model to be so) from day one and stayed as a flat and fluid organization with a headcount of 234+ employees until [17 July 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_GitHub).

### Optimize for Happiness

It's also fascinating that GitHub retained a mindset and developed a culture that emphasizes employee happiness.

They leverage the learnings from open-source communities with tools they use (and built) to build toward simpler and better products, without conventional management methodologies getting in their way.

The mindset and culture reflect in their ability to bring quality products and features live. Contributions are truly self-initiated based on one's interest and passion. Quality assurance goes through peer-reviews and automation. Manual processes, once identified, are automated away to save time and money. They work entirely as a big open-source project. Not surprisingly, they are also a large contributor to various open-source software projects, with an adopted [Open Source (Almost) Everything](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html) mindset.

Such emphasis on employee happiness allows it to attract top talents worldwide, and it reflects in their products to be enjoyed by their users.

### Asynchronous

GitHub employees use and build tools to effectively collaborate and communicate asynchronously with each other in many different time zones. GitHub employees have treated tools as their office (though they have offices to support various needs and preferences) and follow the open-source model of transparency to make all information accessible.

The problem of blocking (or being blocked by) others is mitigated or resolved through the creative use of tools and automation, giving employees more quality time to be in "the zone" that often leads to more innovations. The lack of indoctrination of work hours combined with no fixed locations aforementioned also allows employees to worry less about things that do not matter to their work's core subjects.

<!-- The asynchronous working model works well with an increasingly distributed workforce (and our society at large) that we have been transitioning into. -->

<!-- ## Social Implications

| internet, then and now, and future (decentralization)

The open-source social movement's key idea is to leverage the open-source software communities' learnings to make information and its curation more transparent to its consumers. This social movement coincides with the phenomenon of the internet-driven information explosion and the increasing realization of how closed platforms could manipulate the information's flow and shape.

### People over process

Unlike methodologies and processes grown out of the typical, hierarchal corporate world, open source communities (referred to as "community/communities" from hereon) often come up with methodologies that tend to be pragmatic and objective-focused, eliminating as much middle-people and manual processes as possible. More importantly, community-grown methodologies are highly fluid that adapts to the dynamics and changes of relevant makers, instead of the other way around.

### Round-table wisdom

By eliminating unnecessary middle-people and processes between makers and the outcome (which is transparent to all since open-source), merits become the most important, and perhaps the only way to convince others in a debate, rather than on-paper seniority. The wisdom is collective and the opportunity for contribution is equally given to all.

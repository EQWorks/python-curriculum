# Outro

From Part 00 to 03, we have gone through a short (7 weeks) and a rather unconventional path to learning Python programming.

This outro serves as another background introduction for the journey onward.

## Open-source

The open-source software movement started in the 80s, initially as the "free software movement" by Richard Stallman (a.k.a RMS). Throughout its [evolutionary timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement#Brief_history), many have contributed toward its conceptualization and formulation to tackle legal, business, and to an increasingly relevant extent, societal challenges.

The immediate face-value of open-source software is already appealing to its consumers. These programs are usually free to use. Users can also change the software behaviors with some knowledge of programming to suit individual needs. For the providing party, open-sourcing brings benefits of open scrutiny to the program's quality and security measures, and a showcase of confidence, and statements of styles and opinions.

With some well-defined governance models, open-source software communities can promote a collaborative environment and onboard collaborators with little to no effort from the original authors required by conventional settings. With a mature license, the users understand the provider's limits and liabilities, greatly simplifying the usage contracts and limitations. Lastly, with proper financial backing, the authors and maintainers of the software who pursue these projects as passions of their own tend to innovate and push the boundaries consistently.

## git

Among many means and tools that support the entire open-source software ecosystem, one of the most important pieces would be the use of a version control system (VCS). And among these VCS, `git` is both the most adopted system, as well as its symobolicness of the evolution of the version control systems.

<!-- history, that leads to decentralization -->

## Social Implications

<!-- internet, then and now, and future (decentralization) -->

The open-source social movement's key idea is to leverage the open-source software communities' learnings to make information and its curation more transparent to its consumers. This social movement coincides with the phenomenon of the internet-driven information explosion and the increasing realization of how closed platforms could manipulate the information's flow and shape.

<!-- as a part of workspace meta shift, github example, decentralization, transparency, asynchronous, optimize for happiness, open-source almost everything; eq works, adaptation, workspace automations, "passive" information consumption, flat structure, round-table wisdom, and interest/passion driven development -->

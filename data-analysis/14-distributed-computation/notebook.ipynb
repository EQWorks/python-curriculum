    "## Quick Recap - Multiprocessing vs. Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can utilize multiple CPU cores, thus achieving a more authentic sense of parallel computation. However, multiprocessing suffers when they need to share a common memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multithreading can share a common memory space and achieve a more loose sense of parallel computation. As a result, multithreading is more like hyper-jumping through multiple queues (within the same process) while waiting for each particular thread's turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When it is one specific thread's turn, it will acquire the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to control the memory space _and_ the CPU core until it finishes its designated computation or hits another \"busy-waiting\" block (such as I/O actions).\n",
    "2. Then, the loop releases the GIL and lets the jump proceed (context-switch) to the following thread.\n",
    "3. Rinse and repeat (until done).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can revisit [part 13](../13-data-processing.ipynb) for more details on this subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous I/O Loops, and Multithreading's Little Brother - Coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "Both multiprocessing and multithreading require dedicated hardware or operating system support. As software technologies mature, engineers started to explore capabilities within the application layer itself. As a result, the same conceptual model of multithreading gets a new interpretation within the programming stack (such as Python), giving more direct control to the program within the runtime instead of relying on the OS mechanism to switch context. The term [_Coroutine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), first coined in 1958, is a materialization of the concept of lightweight threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both multithreading and coroutine techniques are suitable for I/O focused tasks, such as reading files from a disk or making HTTP requests. However, coroutines tend to require less computing resource overhead than threads by giving up some performance benefit from tapping into the more OS-native mechanisms."

    "\n",
    "Recall one of the most critical disadvantages of multiprocessing - the lack of shared memory space. One workaround of such an issue is to leverage the filesystem as an inter-process data pool so that multiple processes can simultaneously read and write to it, such as a local SQLite database, as demonstrated in [part 11](../11-work-with-sql.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we extend this problem to a larger scale, where the dataset we want to work with exceeds the available memory space and is impossible to efficiently store (or at all) on the disk of a single machine. In that case, we need to revisit viable solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MapReduce model is a _divide and conquer_ strategy applying and extending the functional programming concepts of `map()` and `reduce()`. Through this model, a large dataset is dissected and distributed through a mapping procedure onto a multitude of computational nodes to parallelize the computation of the smaller portion, then reducing the resulting subsets back to fewer nodes until the cluster concludes the outcome.\n",

    "This model allows batch data processing to have a near-infinite capacity and a relatively cost-effective way to speed up the process.\n",

    "It is worth noting that the development of cheaper and faster hard drives, especially the more widespread adoption of SSDs (solid-state drive), plays a vital role in enabling distributed computation.\n",

    "The MapReduce model was first pioneered [by Google](https://research.google/pubs/pub62/) in 2004 to resolve the practical problem of exponentially growing datasets for computing their search indexes.

    "While it is significantly slower to bootstrap the samples, the aggregation shows a glimpse of Spark's true strength (or the distributed filesystem and the MapReduce model behind it). \n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes to compute the aggregation can be nearly uniform regardless of the given sample size. This scalability characteristic becomes more prominent and essential as a tool to process data when the sample size goes beyond a single machine's capacity, much like the situation that Google encountered in the early 2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its inception, Apache Spark has stayed current thanks to the contributions from open-source participants. For example, it has stream processing support for a more incremental instead of a large batch of MapReduce tasks to achieve near real-time analytics and more.\n",

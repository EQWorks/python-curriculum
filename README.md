## On Exercises

This series does not aim to cover _every_ aspect needed to solve any of the exercise problems provided. The programming language and all the technologies that lead to it are still evolving rapidly.

Instead, what each part covers aims to be just right to whet your appetite and let you know enough to ask the right questions to come to your solutions.

## How to Help and Get Helped

* Make liberal and effective use of online communities such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and search engines such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).
* Consult the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/).
* Collaborate with others.
* Share what you have tried for your problems.
* Share what you have asked for to get your answers.

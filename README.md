## On Exercises

This series does not aim to cover _every_ aspect that is needed to solve any of the exercise problems provided. The programming language and all the technologies that lead to it are still evolving rapidly.

Instead, what each part covers aims to be just right to whet your appetite and let you know enough to ask the right questions to come to your solutions.

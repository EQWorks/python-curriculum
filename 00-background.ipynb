    "### Stage 1 - Digitization\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is formed on a chain of clever abstractions. Digitization lays the foundation for them -- a process which quantizes analog/continuous signals into digital/discrete signals (binaries, or 0s and 1s).\n",
    "\n",
    "![digitization](https://i.imgur.com/4jijPSp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is not the only scientific/engineering concept applied in the realm of computer science and programming. Another concept which would be helpful to understand is the various trade-offs made which made programming (at any given stage of abstractions) possible, or can be made in the practice of programming itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of such trade-offs is the digitization of photography/videography. It loses the theoretically infinite resolution scalability and closer to human eyes-perception of real world provided by the photonic and chemical based solution (film). In return it gains a lot of advantages, to name a few:\n",
    "* Easier to manipulate, post and live (such as camera filters)\n",
    "* Cheaper and easier to store and distribute\n",
    "* Much faster feedback/viewability of the products (instantaneous in most cases)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of film is losing its appeal by the day, due to the development of more powerful camera sensors and image processors that give us higher (often more than enough) pxiel-count and better capability that tones colors, depths and contrast ever more closely to our eyes, and the growing capability in machine-learning based post-processing, etc."

    "### Stage 2 - Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Binaries allow us to manipulate and command computer hardware to do our bidding, but not with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "![encoding](https://i.imgur.com/kbya2PT.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, encoding provides a path between the two parties so that machines and humans can understand each other better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the chain of abstractions, arguably the most important form of encoding exists in the form of Instruction Set Architectures (ISA). These architectures encode hardware instructions that map into combinations of binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept has been applied successfully in the fantasy realm too:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alohomora](https://i.imgur.com/XzkGbOC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One representation of ISAs is in the form of assembly languages. An example from the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) 32-bit architecture looks like such:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MIPS32 addi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Mips32_addi.svg/370px-Mips32_addi.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above assembly instruction (`addi $r1 $r2 350`) takes the value stored in a register (`$r1`), performs the operation (`addi`, or \"add immediate\") to the immediate value (`350`), then store the result into another register (`$r2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "These instructions are about the first layer of near-natural programming languages that humans _can_ program with. But humans generally don't _want_ to program with them, because they are too verbose and lengthy to achieve even the simplest operations. They are also easy for humans to make mistakes because humans are not best at being consistent. For these reasons, computer scientists and engineers come up with solutions such as compilers and virtual machines that translate simpler languages into patterns and series of instructions that are known to be working with given architecture(s)."

    "### Stage 3 - Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "These languages map a subset of logical human natural languages, sometimes through one or many layers of other programming languages, eventually into hardware instructions of one or many suitable ISAs, all through aforementioned abstractions enabled by encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 (from 65,000 participants), these are the actively used/asked-about (25) languages by popularity:\n",
    "![languages](https://i.imgur.com/CE2ZX8W.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these programming languages have their distinct features and strengths that make them suitable over others for certain areas of tasks. Many of them also have overlapping strengths (or weaknesses). So the choice of programming languages for the job often comes down to:\n",
    "1. Trade-offs between apparent strengths needed, and weakness that can be overlooked\n",
    "2. Ecosystem of community, reusable libraries and packages\n",
    "3. Personal or collective preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Like natural (human) languages, they come in various shapes and forms. In the realm of computer science, some of the key variances are classified as language paradigms. These abstracted concepts are important, but they are better acquired through actual practice -- programming. Much like stating perfectly grammatically correct sentences doesn't automatically win you a debate, knowing all aspects of the programming language doesn't automatically write itself and makes you the next Mark Zuckerberg. As natural languages are a toolbox to convey ideas, programming languages are a toolbox to solve problems and accomplish objectives. In such context, ideas, problems, and objectives are more valuable than tools themselves. Therefore in this series, we will ease-in some of the abstracted concepts from various aspects when it matters, but only briefly mention or outright skip many that do not matter."
